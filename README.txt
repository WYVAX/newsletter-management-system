This was the final project in a web development class. It was completed to showcase the technologies learned that semester in one RESTful web service.

It allows an administrator to create, remove, upadate, and delete users and their email addresses from a table in a database as well as send an email to every user containing a "newsletter." Passwords and path names have been hardcoded so this will take some work to get running on a local machine. This is just to show some previous work that I have created.
